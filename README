Files in this Octave Forge package are for analyzing setiQuest data.

These files (mostly .m functions) were developed for GNU Octave, but will 
probably work unmodified with Matlab or Scilab.  

The functions are for analysis and processing of data from the Allen 
Telescope Array (ATA), located in Hat Creek, CA.  

We hope that over time these functions will grow to a useful set of SETI 
processing capabilities.
